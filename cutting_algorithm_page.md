## Genetic algorithm for industrial cuttin

**Project description:** For this project a customer in the industry needed a solution to optimize the cutting of figures in wood panels (1m x 1m). I did a state of the art of what could be done. I finally opted for the implementation of a genetic algorithm.

### 1. Initial situation
The client uses InkScape to generate its figures and simulate their placement on the cutting grid.
A figure consists of a polygon composed of segments and/or BÃ©zier curves.
The grid is simply an InkScape grid with 1000mm spacing. All this is finally stored in an SVG format.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
